A more complex example
Now that you understand the basics, we can move on to an example with a longer calculation.

Say you are helping a friend to calculate their weekly paycheck after taxes.

They're in a 12% tax bracket (in other words, 12% of their salary is taken for taxes, and they only take home 88%), and
They're paid hourly, at a rate of $15/hour.
The function below calculates the paycheck based on the number of hours worked. The function is more complicated than with the first example, because the function has more lines of code and comments. Similar to the example above, the function has a single argument (num hours). In the function body, we:

Use the value for num_hours to specify the value for a new variable pay_pretax.
Use the value of pay_pretax to specify the value for a new variable pay_aftertax.
Return the value of the pay_aftertax variable.
